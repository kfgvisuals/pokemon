        pick which user they are
        in their pokedex:
            search for Pokemon
            see a list of all available pokemon. (maybe grayed out if they haven't captured them?!)
        encounter a random Pokemon
        capture a Pokemon (or choose to ignore)
        see their captured Pokemon
    Add as much more as you want!
